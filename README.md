# Employee-Attrition
Data analysis Project
üìò Employee Attrition Prediction

This project aims to analyze and predict employee attrition ‚Äî identifying the key factors that influence whether an employee is likely to leave the organization. Using data-driven insights, the project helps HR teams and managers make informed decisions to improve retention strategies and overall workforce satisfaction.

üîç Project Overview

Employee attrition (or turnover) is a critical concern for companies as it affects productivity, recruitment costs, and morale. This notebook explores HR data to understand employee behavior, visualize patterns, and build a predictive machine learning model to forecast attrition.

üß† Key Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations.

Identify the most influential features contributing to attrition.

Build and evaluate predictive models to classify employees as likely to stay or likely to leave.

Provide actionable insights to help reduce turnover rates.

üìä Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing trends and understanding relationships between variables.

Model Building: Implementing classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

Model Evaluation: Assessing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results and Insights

Identified key features affecting attrition such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, and income.

Developed a model capable of predicting employee attrition with strong accuracy and interpretability.

Provided insights that can guide HR policies to reduce turnover.
